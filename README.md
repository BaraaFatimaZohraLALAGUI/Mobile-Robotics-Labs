# Introduction to Mobile Robotics - Lab Solutions

This repository contains my lab solutions for the **Introduction to Mobile Robotics** course. Each lab focuses on different aspects of mobile robotics using **ROS 2** and **CoppeliaSim**.

## Labs Overview
- **Lab 01: Introduction to ROS 2**  
  Basic concepts of **ROS 2**, including nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, and basic communication.

- **Lab 02: Introduction to CoppeliaSim and Control of a Differential Drive Robot**  
  Setting up **CoppeliaSim** and integrating it with **ROS 2** to control a differential drive robot.

- **Lab 03: Pose Estimation of a Differential Drive Robot using Extended Kalman Filter** _(In-progress)_  
  Implementing **pose estimation** for a differential drive robot using an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** in **CoppeliaSim**.  
  - **ROS 2 Integration** for sensor data processing and estimation.  
  - **Lua Scripts** for simulation logic.  

- **Lab 04: Potential Field-based Obstacle Avoidance for a Differential Drive Robot**  
  Developing an **obstacle avoidance system** using **potential field methods** for a **differential drive robot** in **ROS 2**.
